These are my dotfiles. The README is not usually up to date.

I usually forget to commit stuff and then commit a bunch of changes at once when I feel like it. This means that the state of the `main` branch is not safe: sometimes changes that should be committed at the same time are split across two or more commits. Don't trust me.
