#    # The output from the EQ can either go direct to a hardware device
#    # (if you have a hardware mixer, e.g. SBLive/Audigy) or it can go
#    # to the software mixer shown here.

#    # Sometimes you may need to specify the path to the plugins,

#    # out/restarted this should not be necessary, but if you get errors
#    # about being unable to find plugins, try uncommenting this.

## Redirect the default device to go via the EQ - you may want to do
## this last, once you are sure everything is working.  Otherwise all
## your audio programs will break/crash if something has gone wrong.
#pcm.!default {
#    type plug
#    slave.pcm "eq"
#}

## Redirect the OSS emulation through the EQ too (when programs are running through "aoss")
#pcm.dsp0 {
#    type plug
#    slave.pcm "eq"
#}

#defaults.pcm.!card 0
#defaults.ctl.!card 0
