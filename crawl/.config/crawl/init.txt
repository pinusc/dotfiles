        Change which key invokes which command at a lower level of
        operation than macros. Useful in that macros cannot (yet)
        invoke each other, but a macro can invoke a command whose
        key has changed.
        The syntax is always the same: [key] command
        First, in square brackets, list the key you want to use, with
        ^X meaning Ctrl-X. After that name the command to be bound to
        that key. You can bind several commands to the same key, as long
        as they take effect in different areas of the game, i.e. one
        targeting command and one for the main game. Likewise, you can
        bind the same command to different keys.
        For a full list of possible commands, see keybind.txt.
